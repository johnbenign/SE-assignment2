# SE-Assignment2: Version Control Using GitHub

## Overview
This project was created as part of **CINS 5318 ‚Äì Software Engineering (Fall 2025)** under the guidance of **Dr. Mary Kim**.  
The objective of this assignment is to gain practical experience using **Git** and **GitHub** for version control, collaboration, and documentation.

The project demonstrates:
- Repository creation and initial commit.
- Working with branches and pull requests.
- Merging and resolving conflicts.
- Tracking tasks using GitHub Issues.
- Maintaining a comprehensive project README.

## Project Description
This project features a simple ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù program that was later enhanced to greet users personally.  
The initial version prints ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù, and I modified it in another feature branch to give a personalized greeting to the user and to trigger a merge conflict:

feature-1 => Hello, World!

feature-2 => Hi! Benign John

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to clone and run the project locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/johnbenign/SE-assignment2.git

# 2. Navigate into the project directory
cd SE-assignment2

# 3. (Optional) Create a new branch for modifications
git checkout -b feature-1

# 4. Run the HelloWorld.java in your favorite IDE
```

## Usage Example

### Output Example:

Hello, World!
Hi! Benign

### Program Description:

- The program starts by displaying a simple "Hello World!" greeting.
- I then modified the to give a personalized greeting the user and to also force a merge conflict.

## üå± Branching and Merging Workflow

| Branch | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | Contains the final merged project | ‚úÖ Merged |
| `feature-1` | Added personalized greeting | ‚úÖ Merged |
| `feature-2` | Simulated and resolved merge conflict | ‚úÖ Merged |

## üß† GitHub Issues

Two GitHub Issues were created and managed to simulate real-world collaboration:

| Issue | Assigned To | Description | Status |
|:------|:-------------|:-------------|:--------|
| #1 Add installation instructions to README | Benign John | Documented setup steps and usage guide | ‚úÖ Closed |
| #2 Improve Hello World feature with user input | Chukwuemeka Kingsley | Enhanced the program to personalize greetings | ‚úÖ Closed |

## üìÑ Reflection Summary

Using GitHub for this assignment improved understanding of collaborative version control.  
Key takeaways include:

- Effective use of branches for isolated development.  
- Understanding pull requests and code reviews.  
- Learning how to resolve merge conflicts.  
- Using Issues to track and manage tasks efficiently.
